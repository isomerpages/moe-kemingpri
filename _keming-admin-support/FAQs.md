</ul>
<p><strong>6. What are the modes of payment?<br /></strong>Monthly fee payment can be made in cash or through cheques / GIRO.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage parents to make fee payment via GIRO as this would help reduce the amount of time the SCC staff members spend on fee administration, and free up more time to spend with the students.</p>
