<h4><strong>Bukit Batok Community Club</strong></h4>
<p>All Primary 4 to Primary 6 students participated in the Bukit Batok Citizens' Consultative Committee's (CCC) Walkathon Donation Drive. This is one of our students&rsquo; Values In Action (VIA) activities under our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of Assisting the Needy. Through this activity, we hope to inculcate in our students the Values of Care for the needy and Social Responsibility as a Concerned Citizen by contributing back to the Bukit Batok community that they have benefitted from. The CCC disburses bursaries to needy students, meal vouchers, daily Share-A-Meal and welfare assistance etc. to the needy residents of Bukit Batok. Over 3 200 residents benefit from these various schemes each year. We are glad to do our part for the community.</p>
<h4><strong>Econ Life! Hub (Bukit Batok)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Grandparents' Day<br /></strong>Senior citizens from Econ Life! Hub (Bukit Batok) had the opportunity to watch the performances put up by our Kemingnites and they participated in the activities organised by the Primary 6 students for the Exhalaration Fair.</p>
