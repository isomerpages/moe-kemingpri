<h4><strong>Partnership with Bukit View Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>Primary 6 students went to Bukit View Secondary School and they were guided on a project on Environment. The students from Bukit View Secondary School taught our students the positive and negative effects Man has impacted the environment and what our future generations could do to make the world a better place to live in. The students experimented on the pH value that enables living things to grow best and also saw the development of a butterfly through the different stages.</p>
