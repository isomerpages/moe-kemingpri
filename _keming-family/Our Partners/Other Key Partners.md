<h4><strong>Partnership with Singapore Heart Foundation</strong></h4>
<p>In collaboration with the Singapore Heart Foundation (SHF), the school conducted this outreach programme to inculcate in the Primary 4 students the awareness on the importance of knowing the optimal blood pressure reading, and to pass on the knowledge to their families. This project promotes heart health family units to support SHF's mission to reduce this high risk.</p>
<p>Each student was trained on both theory and practical knowledge of High Blood Pressure. Upon the completion of the training, each Primary 4 student received on loan a blood pressure monitor for them to bring home to administer what they had learnt to their immediate families.</p>
