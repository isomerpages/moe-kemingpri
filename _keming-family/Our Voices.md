<p>The one thing that made me return to Keming after contract teaching and studying in NIE is the culture of care and concern among the staff. It is without a doubt that the staff would go the extra mile for the students and fellow colleagues. It is because the school values are not merely inculcated in students but are also practised seamlessly among the staff which makes being in Keming safe and comfortable.</p>

<p>I joined Keming Primary School in 2014 and the first thing that struck me was the school's strong culture of care. It was evident in all aspects and people, from the teachers to students and even the supporting staff members. My time here has been both enriching and enjoyable, and I cannot be more proud to be a part of this Keming family!</p>

<p>I have been with Keming Primary School since June 2007. Through the years, I&rsquo;ve seen Kemingnites&nbsp;<strong>grow and glow</strong>, true to its motto, and I&rsquo;m happy to be part of this family.</p>
<p>My heartfelt appreciation goes to two enthusiastic groups of people who have volunteered their precious time week after week, to provide extra support to some of our students. Thank you for walking this journey with me.</p>

<p>I find Keming staff helpful and friendly. They are willing to share their knowledge and skills with me when I am not sure or when I do not know how to do something. I am happy to be here at Keming Primary School.</p>
