<p>The Chinese Dance is a performing art which provides pleasure for both the performers and the audience. The members are introduced to both the traditional Chinese dances and contemporary works. The training is beneficial for the general physique and co-ordination of the body, developing flexibility and stamina.</p>
<p>Through this CCA, the students learn self-management, teamwork spirit, sportsmanship and responsible decision-making. Our dancers are constantly being challenged to learn varied dance techniques and different dance forms to attain greater heights of performance. Members are also given opportunities to display their talents through various school concerts and community events. To date, the group has achieved good results at the SYF competitions.</p>
