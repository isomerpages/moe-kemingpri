<p>Keming Chinese Orchestra Club aspires to nurture and develop our members into appreciating the beautiful sounds of Chinese Orchestral music through various musical instruments. Our members gain invaluable experiences by applying their musical skills through school and public performances throughout the year.</p>
<p>Through music, we aim to develop and build our students' character, aligning with our school's R3ICH values.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music. ... I get most joy in life out of music.&rdquo;- Albert Einstein</em></p>
