<p>The International Dance CCA aims to nurture and groom students, both boys
and girls, to excel in the area of dance. The CCA strives to ignite the
passion for dance in young talents and aims for high standards of achievements
in all activities and performances that we participate in. Our members
are exposed to different dance genres like ballet, contemporary, modern
jazz. In the process of learning, they will gain skills in a variety of
dance moves and performance techniques. We also develop and build our students'
character aligned to our school's R³ICH values.</p>
<p>The members will participate in school events such as Chinese New Year
Celebration, Love@Keming and P1 Orientation.</p>
