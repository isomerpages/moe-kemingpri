<p>The International Dance CCA aims to nurture and groom students, both boys and girls, to excel in the area of dance. The CCA strives to ignite the passion for dance in young talents and aims for high standards of achievements in all activities and performances that we participate in. Our members are exposed to different dance genres like ballet, contemporary, modern jazz. In the process of learning, they will gain skills in a variety of dance moves and performance techniques. We also develop and build our students' character aligned to our school's R&sup3;ICH values.</p>
<p>The members will participate in school events such as Chinese New Year Celebration, Love@Keming and P1 Orientation.</p>
