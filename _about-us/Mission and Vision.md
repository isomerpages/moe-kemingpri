<h4><strong>School Mission<br></strong>Connecting Hearts, Engaging Minds</h4>
<p>We want to build a culture of care and culture of learning by connecting
the hearts and engaging the minds of our students and staff. &nbsp;In this
way, we can realise our vision of “Every Kemingnite: A Curious Learner.
An Empathetic Leader. A Confident Contributor.</p>
<h4>Connecting Hearts (Culture of Care)</h4>
<p>We build a culture of care by connecting with our students through quality
relationships so that they will develop holistically. Quality relationship
is built by accepting the individual, acknowledging their abilities and
talents, and helping them to achieve their personal best.</p>
<p>Our staff build quality relationships with one another by having open
and regular conversations, fostering collegiality and a conducive working
environment.</p>
<p>We partner our stakeholders to enrich the school experiences that positively
impact our students’ overall development.</p>
<h4>Engaging Minds (Culture of Learning)</h4>
<p>We build a culture of learning by nurturing our students to have the knowledge,
skills and values so that they develop a growth mindset, are anchored in
values, and make a positive impact on others.</p>
<p>As a community of passionate and collaborative learners, our staff continues
to learn and grow for improvement and innovation.</p>
