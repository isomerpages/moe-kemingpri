<h4><strong>School Beliefs</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that</p>
<p>(1) Every child can learn, whatever his starting point.<br />- We can help each child find success in learning.</p>
<p>(2) Every child is unique.<br />- Each child will therefore succeed in different ways.</p>
<p>(3) Every child needs different attributes to succeed in the future.<br />- We will nurture the whole child.</p>
<h4><strong>School Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>We believe in nurturing the whole child by guiding and helping our students to develop their moral, aesthetic, physical, intellectual, emotional and social (MAPIES) domains to the full so that they will become good and useful citizens.</p>
<p>In other words, Education@Keming aims to</p>
<p>(1) develop character by anchoring our students in the R&sup3;ICH Values and equipping them with Social Emotional (SE) Competencies*</p>
<p>(2) build a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy skills as well as inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry and equipping our students with the 21st Century Competencies* for future education, employment and citizenship</p>
<p>Our motto "Grow and Glow" will be our rallying call to achieve and realise our Vision, Mission and Core values. We hope to grow our students in the MAPIES domains so that they glow to be good and useful citizens.</p>
