<p><strong>(Grow &amp; Glow)<br /></strong>O Keming we have come<br />To learn, to share and to care<br />We will serve with pride and honour<br />For the glory yours and mine.</p>
<p><em>Chorus:<br /></em>We will grow and we will glow,<br />Together we will build<br />We will grow and we will glow,<br />A better tomorrow<br />We will build.</p>
<p>Let the motto be our guide,<br />Together we work and learn.<br />Forward, upward we will strive,<br />There&rsquo;s a place for everyone.</p>
<p><em>Chorus:<br /></em>We will grow and we will glow,<br />Together we will build<br />We will grow and we will glow,<br />A better tomorrow<br />We will build.</p>
