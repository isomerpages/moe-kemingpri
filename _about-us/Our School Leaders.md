<p>It is with great honour and humility that I join the Keming family as
the new Principal. As we celebrate 90 years of Keming’s proud heritage
and history, we give thanks for the strong foundations laid by generations
of educators, students, parents and partners who have shaped the school
into what it is today.</p>
<p>Keming’s Chinese name, 克明, carries a meaningful story. It signifies one’s
ability to overcome adversities and emerge stronger, moving towards a promising
future. This spirit has been deeply embedded in our school’s journey over
the past nine decades, and it continues to guide us as we nurture each
Kemingnite to rise above challenges with resilience and purpose.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, our shared vision is clear: Every Kemingnite – A Curious
Learner. An Empathetic Leader. A Confident Contributor. We aspire to be
a hope-building school where every student is supported to discover their
passions, interests and strengths, and to develop to their fullest potential
as future-ready individuals.</p>
<p>Guided by our mission of fostering a Culture of Care and a Culture of
Learning, we strive to create an environment where every learner feels
valued, supported and inspired. By connecting hearts and engaging minds,
we will continue to build a strong community where learning is meaningful,
relationships are nurtured, and every Kemingnite is empowered to flourish.</p>
<p>The School Leadership team, comprising of myself and Vice Principals,
Ms Ng Mei Yun and Mr Tay Khye Ping, looks forward to working closely with
all of you as we honour our legacy and write the next chapter of Keming’s
journey together.</p>
