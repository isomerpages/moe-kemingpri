<h4><strong>I.N.S.P.I.R.E. The Scientist in Me</strong></h4>
<p>(<strong>IN</strong>quiry&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>cience&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>rojects&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>nvolving&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>esearch and&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xperiments)</p>
<p>STEM Education is incorporated in Project Work which is carried out from Primary 3 to Primary 5. It engages students in understanding the science concepts and teaches them skills that is applicable in the future aside from immediately applying them to the relevant aspects of their lives now.</p>
<p>Students use the Engineering Design Process to think of the data they needed to gather and using the data gathered, to help them create a prototype, which involves the use of Micro:bit. Scientific process skills such as controlling variables, interpreting data, planning and designing investigations for problem solving are being emphasized in the process.</p>

<h4><strong>Primary 1 (E.X.P.L.O.R.E.)</strong></h4>
<p>Primary 1 students were introduced to the basics of block programming and they were guided step-by-step to recognize the different blocks in the makecode platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They gained a better understanding of the different applications of Micro:bit such as automated watering system, remote control, music devices and many more.</p>

<h4><strong>Primary 2 (E.X.P.L.O.R.E.)</strong></h4>
<p>In Primary 2, students were given a chance to deepen their knowledge of what they had learnt earlier. They did the coding in the makecode platform and assembled their own light detector. Using the light sensor application in the Micro:bit, they were able to check the brightness of the room and used it to turn off the lights when not needed in order to conserve energy.<br />Students were given the opportunity to explore and test their codes. They collaborated with one another and helped each other out when they faced challenges.</p>

<h4><strong>Junior Scientist (P3 Guided inquiry)</strong></h4>
<p>P3 students created structures using building elements from Strawbees. During the training sessions, they were taught to apply simple principles of movement to build mechanisms that were required to construct a mobile.</p>
<p>Strawbees allows students to be innovative through hands-on exploration as they construct their ingenious design. Students gain a better understanding of mechanisms with their inventions.</p>

<h4><strong>Apprentice Scientist (P4 Guided inquiry)</strong></h4>
<p>Students learnt the importance of producing sufficient food to be self-sustainable and in turn, contributing to food security in Singapore. The hydroponics project enable students to experience harvesting vegetables such as water spinach and kangkong, taking note of the ideal conditions for plant growth.</p>

<h4><strong>Master Scientist (P5 Guided Inquiry)</strong></h4>
<p>Primary 5 students were tasked to design a prototype that could save endangered animals. They identified the threats faced by the endangered animals. Using the Engineering Design Process, the students work in teams to brainstorm ideas and design their own unique prototype to counter the threat.</p>
<p>To enrich the students&rsquo; learning experiences, the school partnered with external agencies. The experts from S.E.A. Aquarium engaged our students in an hour long zoom session. Students were thrilled to go on a virtual tour of the Aquarium and to interact with the keepers who cared for the animals. During the interactive session, the keepers spoke about a specific sea creature and the threats the animal faced in the wild.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make learning authentic, students were informed about conservation efforts done in the school. Students were encouraged to visit the turtle enclosure in the school garden to understand the constraints and vulnerability of animal habitats. Students were then tasked to reflect on their role in the conservation of biodiversity. Through these activities, students could better appreciate nature and understand the efforts in sustaining conservation.</p>

<h4><strong>D.I.S.C.O.V.E.R Programme</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">(<strong>D</strong>eveloping<strong>&nbsp;I</strong>nquirers of&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>cien<strong>C</strong>e, Inn<strong>OV</strong>ators of&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xperimental&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>esearch in Keming Primary School)</p>
<p>D.I.S.C.O.V.E.R. programme provides an opportunity for students to gain a deeper understanding of how Science and Technology can shape their intellectual and cultural environment. Students are equipped with skills to be reflective, ethical citizens and critical thinkers while engaging in environment-related issues.</p>
<p>This programme provides an authentic learning experience which focusses on the impact of pollution in our natural environment. Under the guidance of experts, two scientists from A*STAR will mentor the Primary 5 students to study about the environmental issues that Singapore faces. Due to the current safe management measures, learning for the students took place online this year. Students collaborated well with their team members online and they came up with creative ways to gather data.</p>
