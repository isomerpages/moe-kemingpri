<p>(<strong>IN</strong>quiry&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>cience&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>rojects&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>nvolving&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>esearch and&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xperiments)</p>
<p>STEM Education is incorporated in Project Work which is carried out from Primary 3 to Primary 5. It engages students in understanding the science concepts and teaches them skills that is applicable in the future aside from immediately applying them to the relevant aspects of their lives now.</p>
<p>Students use the Engineering Design Process to think of the data they needed to gather and using the data gathered, to help them create a prototype, which involves the use of Micro:bit. Scientific process skills such as controlling variables, interpreting data, planning and designing investigations for problem solving are being emphasized in the process.</p>
