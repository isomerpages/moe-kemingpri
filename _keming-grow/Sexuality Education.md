<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters in their growing up years. Sexuality Education also aims to help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and others, premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>It is named Sexuality Education (rather than Sex Education) to emphasise the holistic approach which includes the emotional, social, intellectual and ethical aspects, in addition to the physical aspect of sexuality.</p>
<p>The child is always the focus and main concern of Sexuality Education, which is anchored on the values of love, respect and responsibility. Sexuality Education is provided for our children in their growing up years as they experience various developmental milestones. It helps them to navigate the demands and complexities of the environment that surrounds them.</p>
<p>The home, school and community need to work in close partnership for the effective Sexuality Education of our children in their growing up years.</p>
