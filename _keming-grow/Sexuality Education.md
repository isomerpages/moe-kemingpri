<p><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students
to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience
as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those
with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are:</p>
<p>(i) To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through
the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate <u>knowledge</u> on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of <u>social and emotional skills</u> of self-awareness,
management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy
for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and
decision-making skills; and</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help students
develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual
beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the
inculcation of <u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u> about sexuality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Build positive relationships based on love and</p>
<p>respect (which are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence
before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended
pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Keming Primary School’s Sexuality Education Programme for 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered
in a holistic manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality
Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal
Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and
Law. You may click <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/programmes/social-emotional-learning/sexuality-education/scope/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> (Insert

for more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school
curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjects that incorporate topics
on sexuality include:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE)</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper primary years mark the
onset of puberty. With better nutrition and improved health care, children
are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with physical,
emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication is that
our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity sooner
without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity
to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore, our young are also exposed to
a wide range of influences that could endanger health and undermine the
integrity of the family. Our students require guidance so that they can
respond with discernment to the sexual messages in the media and other
sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are
taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. In SEd, students learn
to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience
as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those
with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters.&nbsp;</p>

infatuated with someone does not mean that they should be involved in a
romantic relationship. Instead, they should focus on building strong and
healthy friendships with their circles of friends.</p>
