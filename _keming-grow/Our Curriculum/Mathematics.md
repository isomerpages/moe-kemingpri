<h4><strong>Curricular Goal</strong></h4>
<p>To build a community of independent and effective problem solvers.</p>
<p>The Mathematics fraternity aims to develop our students to become effective problem solvers. Students acquire proficiency in problem-solving skills through the use of the CPA (Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract) approach in the rigorous Mathematics curriculum. Inquiry and the gradual release of responsibility models are used as pedagogical approaches to develop confidence, co-operation and curiosity in our students.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics Programmes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Performance Tasks &ndash; Learning activities such as practical tasks and authentic learning experiences that students are engaged in to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in a specific topic.</li>
<li>Learning Journeys (LJs)/ Mathematics Trails &ndash; Students are exposed to authentic learning experiences beyond the classroom.</li>
