<h4><strong>Curricular Goal</strong></h4>
<p>To build a community of independent and effective problem solvers.</p>
<p>The Mathematics fraternity aims to develop our students to become effective
problem solvers. Students acquire proficiency in problem-solving skills
through the use of the CPA (Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract) approach in the
rigorous Mathematics curriculum. Inquiry and the gradual release of responsibility
models are used as pedagogical approaches to develop confidence, co-operation
and curiosity in our students.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics Programmes</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Performance Tasks – Learning activities such as practical tasks and authentic
learning experiences that students are engaged in to demonstrate their
knowledge and skills in a specific topic.</p>
