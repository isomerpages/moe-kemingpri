<h4><strong>Curricular Goal</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Confident and Effective Communicators of the English Language</strong></p>
<p>We strive to develop in our students a love for learning and a strong foundation in the English Language, leading them to be&nbsp;<strong>empathetic communicators</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>discerning readers</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>creative inquirers</strong>&nbsp;of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century through effective learning and teaching approaches.</p>
<h4><strong>English Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong><em>lower primary</em></strong>&nbsp;classrooms, students learn to read through shared reading of big books and this is followed by rich language experiences that develop their language skills in relation to the themes.</p>
