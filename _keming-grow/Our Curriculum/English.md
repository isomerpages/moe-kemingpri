<h4><strong>Curricular Goal</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Confident and Effective Communicators of the English Language</strong></p>
<p>We strive to develop in our students a love for learning and a strong foundation in the English Language, leading them to be&nbsp;<strong>empathetic communicators</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>discerning readers</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>creative inquirers</strong>&nbsp;of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century through effective learning and teaching approaches.</p>
<h4><strong>English Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong><em>lower primary</em></strong>&nbsp;classrooms, students learn to read through shared reading of big books and this is followed by rich language experiences that develop their language skills in relation to the themes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Primary One students putting up their hands to choose their favourite big book for shared reading.</em></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Modified Learning Experience Approach (MLEA)</strong>&nbsp;provides students with shared experiences, giving them the content and context to apply the language skills acquired for writing.</p>

<p>As students move up to the&nbsp;<strong>upper primary</strong>, they read to learn and progressively deepen their language skills through strategies like Supported Reading, KWL (what they&nbsp;<strong>K</strong>now, what they&nbsp;<strong>W</strong>ant to know and what they have&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>earnt), Retelling, the Writing Process Cycle and Differentiated Instruction.

<h4><strong>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>for Primary 1 and 2 students</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</strong>&nbsp;provides additional support for students with weak language and literacy skills to cope with the mainstream curriculum in the lower primary. The main objective of LSP is to equip students with basic reading and spelling skills, and at the same time, develop their confidence in using the English Language.</p>
<img style="width: 85%;" src="/images/eng3.png" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The LSP students are also given the following support to accelerate their reading skills.</em></p>
<p>(i) <u>Buddy Reading Support</u></p>
<p>Each student is paired with a P3/P4 tutor who uses graded readers to guide him/her in reading. This programme takes place every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday morning at the school library.</p>
<img style="width: 85%;" src="/images/eng4.png" />
<p>(ii) <u>Reading Support with Moo-O Plus</u></p>
<p>Students will use an interactive app &lsquo;Moo-O Plus&rsquo; that helps them to improve their English Language skills, mainly in reading, fluency and speaking by transforming them into talking story characters on screen. This programme for the LSP students takes place every Friday afternoon in the Computer Lab.</p>
<img style="width: 85%;" src="/images/eng5.png" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>P2 students read the digital storybook in the Computer Lab, following which, they record their reading aloud of the story online.</em></p>
<p><em>*Both the Buddy Reading Programme and Reading Support with Moo-O Plus will resume after the Covid-19 situation.</em></p>
<h4><strong>Reading Support Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>for Primary 3 and 4 students</strong></p>
<p>To support P3 &amp; P4 students who have difficulty in reading, we have&nbsp;<strong>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR)</strong>&nbsp;in a small group setting conducted on a regular basis (4 times a week). Teachers who are specially trained to reach out to this group of learners conduct structured lessons with close monitoring of students&rsquo; progress.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</strong>&nbsp;targets P3 &amp; P4 students who are weak at English Language but without reading difficulties. Structured lessons are conducted twice a week with close monitoring of students&rsquo; progress to strengthen students&rsquo; foundation and equip them with essential skills for ease of learning in class.</p>
<h4><strong>Reading Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>Studies have shown that the more children read, the better readers and writers they become. Our students are engaged in a series of reading activities that widen their knowledge and deepen their reading skills. Besides the regular&nbsp;<strong>Drop Everything And Read (DEAR) programme</strong>, we engage students in reading recommended storybooks and magazines using the&nbsp;<strong>literature approach</strong>&nbsp;in the classrooms. While the lower primary students enrich their reading experiences through&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Moo-O Plus&rsquo;</strong>, an interactive system with a wide range of electronic books, the upper primary students subscribe to the&nbsp;<strong>Little Red Dot</strong>&nbsp;<strong>newspapers</strong>&nbsp;that provide them with the exposure to current affairs.</p>

<p>In addition, students are engaged in Pick-and-Tell, Readers Theatre, storytelling, dramatisation as well as book talks in class.</p>

<h4><strong>Language &amp; Library Week</strong></h4>
<p>To promote a love for reading and the joy of learning the English Language, we engaged students in a series of fun-filled activities like character dress-up, reading picnic, pyjama party, movie screening, book talks, games, writing contest and mass borrowing during Language and Library Week &ndash; an annual highlight for all in Keming.</p>
<p>In 2019, the theme was&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Characters Come Alive&rsquo;</strong>. Let&rsquo;s catch a glimpse of our Kemingnites in action during Language and Library Week in 2019!</p>
<p>Students dressing up as their favourite book characters:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The teachers joined in the fun as well! Can you guess which characters they were dressed up as?</p>

<p>The outdoor reading picnic was a delightful experience for students. Somehow, reading feels way more pleasurable outside the usual classroom setting.</p>
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/eng13.png" />
<p><strong>Movie Screening</strong>&nbsp;is an all-time favourite during the Language and Library Week every year!<br />Students flocked to the library to watch their favourite characters come alive on screen during recess.</p>
<img style="width: 80%;" src="/images/eng14.jpg" />
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>English Learning Trail</strong>&nbsp;is another highlight of the Language &amp; Library Week with students visiting the various learning stations to learn about famous authors and the books written by them. Students also had fun at the stations where they participated in a challenge to see who could say the tongue twisters in the shortest time!</p>
<img style="width: 80%;" src="/images/eng15.png" />
<p>Students were thrilled when our Vice-Principal, Ms Saraswathy, made a guest appearance during the storytelling session.</p>

<h4><strong>Professional Development of Teachers</strong></h4>
<p>Our English teachers believe in sharpening the saw. To reach out to students more effectively, we develop ourselves professionally by attending courses and engaging in professional dialogues.</p>
