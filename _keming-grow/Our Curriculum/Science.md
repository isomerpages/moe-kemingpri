<h4><strong>Curricular Goal</strong></h4>
<p><strong>A Community of Science Inquirers<br /></strong></p>
<p>Keming Primary adopts an inquiry-based approach to learning science. This investigative approach to learning requires students to investigate a problem, search for possible solutions, make observations, ask questions, test out ideas, and think critically to make a final decision.</p>
<p>Inquiry-based learning allows students to explore, develop explanations for the phenomena under investigation, elaborate on concepts and processes, and evaluate their understanding in light of available evidence. Scientific knowledge, scientific inquiry and scientific skills are emphasised in classroom teaching to achieve the 21st century competencies as desired outcomes in our curriculum.</p>

<h4><strong>Every Child A Seed</strong></h4>
<p>This programme provides every child an opportunity to grow their own plants. Each student was given a plant starter kit consisting of a pot, potting mix and a mixture of Sweet Basil, Sunflower and Roselle seeds. Students were elated when they saw their plants grow as they overcame the challenges of the planting and watering process. Students also developed a sense of responsibility and care for the environment, knowing that plants provide us with useful materials in our daily lives.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Garden Trail</strong></h4>
<p>Our Primary 3 students took a nature walk in the school garden to learn more about plants and their parts. Students worked collaboratively as a team to complete different tasks at the activity stations.</p>
<p>Through the trail, the P3 children gained insights beyond the Science textbooks, learning through an authentic and engaging experience.</p>

<h4><strong>SCIENCE E2K Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The E2K Science Programme offers opportunities for students to engage in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced science concepts through an inquiry approach. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme allow students to gain competencies such as critical thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
<p>Students in the E2K Science programme learnt to work collaboratively to solve investigative tasks. They bounced off ideas with each other and work harmoniously to tackle the problem and come up with a conclusion. They considered all aspects before making a decision as they respect the views of each member in the team.</p>

<h4><strong>I.G.N.I.T.E. Lessons</strong></h4>
<p>(<strong>In</strong>spiring&nbsp;<strong>G</strong>rowth&nbsp;<strong>N</strong>&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>nquiry&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>hrough&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xploration)</p>
<p>I.G.N.I.T.E. lessons allow students to put their science concepts learnt into practice. Students get to build and create parachutes, towers and wind-powered cars and through trials and modifications, come up with the best model for their final presentation.</p>
<p>In order to design the best parachute that can stay in the air for the longest time, the Primary 3 students need to find out which type of materials will be best for the canopy and how wind and other factors can affect the time the parachute can stay afloat.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Parachute</strong></p>
<p>Primary 4 students take on the challenge of building the tallest tower using newspapers. They need to know how to fold the newspapers to ensure the sturdiness of the tower, so the tower is well-supported at the base and will not collapse.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tallest Building</strong></p>
<p>Primary 5 students create a wind-powered car using recycled cardboard materials. They can remodel the car after fixing the parts to test on the furthest distance that the car can move after their modifications.</p>

<h4><strong>Science Monitor Training</strong></h4>
<p>With the assistance of the Parent Volunteers, the Primary 3 and 4 Science monitors had fun planting seeds such as tomato, basil, kangkong or chilli seeds in soil. They learn more about the conditions needed for seeds to grow well.</p>

<h4><strong>Service Learning at River Safari for Science Monitors</strong></h4>
<p>Primary 4 Science Monitors are trained by Zoo Educators at the River Safari. Thereafter, they are given the opportunity to transfer their learning to others.</p>
<p>In the programme, each Primary 4 Science Monitor partners two to three Primary 3 students and explains to them how the organisms in the River Safari survive and how we could take better care of them to prevent extinction. These students practice leadership skills and how to communicate their learning to others.</p>

<h4><strong>Zoo Comes to School (2019)</strong></h4>
<p>Primary 3 students had a chance to see how animals are being ill-treated while exported through illegal trading when the Zoo Educators brought these animals to school. Many of these animals usually die along the way before they reach their destinations as the animals are not suited to travel harsh and long distances. This exhibit showed students how to protect animals from harm and to ensure that animals are treated with humanity.</p>

<h4><strong>LOVE@Keming (2019)</strong></h4>
<p>Students acted as guides to parents and visitors during LOVE@Keming Family Day. These student facilitators researched on the adaptive features of the plants in the green spaces of the school and introduced them to the guests. Through interactive engagement with the public, these students learnt how to present research information confidently, thus fulfilling the school mission of Connecting Hearts, Engaging Minds.</p>

<h4><strong>Partnership with Bukit View Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>Primary 6 students take a trip to Bukit View Secondary School and are given a guided tour on an Environmental Trail. Students of Bukit View Secondary School teach our Kemingnites on the positive and negative impact that Man has made on the environment. The students of Bukit View Secondary then lead an active discussion with Kemingnites on the practical things they can do to make the world a better place using the different methods to conserve Earth&rsquo;s resources.</p>

<h4><strong>Hosting Foreign Visitors</strong></h4>
<p>Our Primary 5 students play good hosts to our foreign visitors. Our visitors are brought on a short trail around the garden to get to know our local plants and their adaptive features. Learning is enhanced with the use of several applications in tablets to enrich the visitor&rsquo;s understanding of plants.</p>
