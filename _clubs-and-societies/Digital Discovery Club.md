<p>The Infocomm Club aims to enthuse its members about information communication
in a fun and meaningful way. Members will have the opportunity to express
their creativity, develop problem-solving skills and cultivate teamwork.</p>
<p>Members embark on learning journeys, sharing and training sessions that
expose them to the ever-changing advancement of information technology.
Students learn to use ICT tools to design posters and create animation.
Students are also taught coding, Minecraft Education programmes and photography
skills. Adding on, students also went on learning journeys to Hort Park
to apply their photography skills and take photos for project-based assignments
and photography and coding competitions organised by external organisations.</p>
