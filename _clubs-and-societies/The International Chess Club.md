<p>The Chess Club comprises a team of enthusiasts who are passionate in the pursuit of their common interest in chess. During the sessions, there are opportunities for our players to engage in friendly sparring games to develop and hone their skills in chess. Besides regular practices in school, the members will be trained to take part in 2 major tournaments a year. They are the National Schools Individual Chess Championships in March and the National Schools Team Chess Championships in September. We encourage those who want to make new friends and, at the same time, be involved in a meaningful and enriching sport, to join us.</p>
<p>During the 1st CCA session, the coaches will assess the students and place them in the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Beginner</li>
<li>Advanced</li>
</ol>
<p>As their skills improve, the students in the beginner group will join the advanced group where they will be trained for the various competitions.</p>
