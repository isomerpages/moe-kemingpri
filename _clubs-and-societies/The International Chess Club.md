<p>The Chess Club comprises a team of enthusiasts who are passionate in the
pursuit of their common interest in chess. During the sessions, there are
opportunities for our players to engage in friendly sparring games to develop
and hone their skills in chess. Besides regular practices in school, the
members will be trained to take part in 2 major tournaments a year. They
are the National Schools Individual Chess Championships in March and the
National Schools Team Chess Championships in September. We encourage those
who want to make new friends and, at the same time, be involved in a meaningful
and enriching sport, to join us.</p>
<p>During the 1st CCA session, the coaches will assess the students and place
them in the following categories:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Beginner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As their skills improve, the students in the beginner group will join
the advanced group where they will be trained for the various competitions.</p>
