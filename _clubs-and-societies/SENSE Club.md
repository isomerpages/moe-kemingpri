**S.EN.S.E Club** is a merger of our Eco Club and Science Club and the acronym **S.EN.S.E** represents: Science, Environment, Sustainability, and Eco-Friendly.
<br>
<br>
The **S.EN.S.E Club** aims to increase Kemingnites’ awareness on current issues related to the environment. Students will use scientific knowledge and approaches to investigate, test and find solutions to issues of concern to them. They will also participate in varied activities and platforms to become Green Ambassadors and learn to take concrete actions that contribute to sustainable living in their own ways.</p>

<h4>Activities </h4>

**SINGAPORE AMAZING FLYING MACHINE COMPETITION**

Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC) is an exciting and unique event organised by DSO National Laboratories and Science Centre Singapore, and supported by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF). Students explore the science behind flight and create their 
very own flying machines.

**MILK PLASTICS EXPERIMENT**

How can milk be changed into plastic? <br>
Milk contains molecules of a protein called casein. When vinegar is added to milk, the pH of the milk changes. The pH change causes the casein molecules to unfold and re-organise into long chains, curdling the milk. The curds can then be kneaded and moulded into a material similar in look and feel to plastic.
