<h4><strong>My School, My Voice</strong></h4>
<p>What is &ldquo;My School, My Voice&rdquo;? &ldquo;My School, My Voice" is a platform where our students give their views on what happens within the school. As a school, it is our desire to empower students and to affirm that their opinions and ideas are cherished. In short, the &ldquo;My School, My Voice&rdquo; student board is a powerful tool to not only inspire students to be confident persons, concerned citizens, active contributors but also allow us to get an insight of their thoughts and feelings about themselves, others and the events that take place in Keming Primary School.</p>
