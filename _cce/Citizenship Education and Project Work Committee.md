<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>1. Project work<br />Project work provides the platform for students to apply the knowledge learnt across various subjects. Our project work is purposefully tied to Citizenship Education themes to help our students have a better understanding of local and global issues happening around them.</p>
<p><em>Primary 3 &ndash; Great Mouse Escape<br /></em>A storyline approach is adopted to help students understand the effects of global warming. Students apply the concepts of materials in creating vessels that could sail over a given distance.</p>
<p><em>Primary 4 &ndash; Hydroponics<br /></em>A practical approach to help students understand the importance of high-tech farming in Singapore where land is scarce.</p>
<p><em>Primary 5 &ndash; Marine Conservation<br /></em>Students take on an active role in being an advocate of marine conservation. Leveraging on the use of IT, students create blogs to raise the awareness of marine conservation among their peers.</p>
