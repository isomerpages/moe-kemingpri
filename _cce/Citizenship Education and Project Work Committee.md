<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>1. Project work<br />Project work provides the platform for students to apply the knowledge learnt across various subjects. Our project work is purposefully tied to Citizenship Education themes to help our students have a better understanding of local and global issues happening around them.</p>
<p><em>Primary 3 &ndash; Great Mouse Escape<br /></em>A storyline approach is adopted to help students understand the effects of global warming. Students apply the concepts of materials in creating vessels that could sail over a given distance.</p>
<p><em>Primary 4 &ndash; Hydroponics<br /></em>A practical approach to help students understand the importance of high-tech farming in Singapore where land is scarce.</p>
<p><em>Primary 5 &ndash; Marine Conservation<br /></em>Students take on an active role in being an advocate of marine conservation. Leveraging on the use of IT, students create blogs to raise the awareness of marine conservation among their peers.</p>
<p>2. Environment Education<br />Our environmental Programme provides the platform for students to live out their value of being socially responsible. Students engage their &lsquo;head, heart and hands&rsquo; to perform meaningful activities that contribute to a cleaner and greener environment around them.</p>
<p><em>Green Schools @ Southwest<br /></em>Through the participation of various modules on the different aspects of environment education, students acquire the knowledge and skills to keep our environment clean and green.</p>
<p><em>SELF ( Students Embrace Litter Free)<br /></em>This is an education outreach programme by NEA. Students engage in litter-free activities and commit to this value. Every year, our students perform a beach cleaning exercise to enable them to apply the knowledge on litter-free and use their hands to live out this value.</p>
<p><em>Recycling Outreach Programme<br /></em>Our students take on an active role in practising the 4Rs &ndash; Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. In phrase 2 of this programme, students conduct an outreach to the parents to equip them with the knowledge of 4Rs. They also conduct a &lsquo;Bring your Recyclables&rsquo; Day to encourage parents to use their hands to contribute positively towards the environment.</p>
<p><em>Green for Hope<br /></em>A paper collection exercise in collaboration with CapitaLand.</p>
<p>3. Social Studies and National Education<br />The various commemorative days such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, and the National Education programmes such as learning journeys serve to instil in pupils a sense of belonging and commitment to the school, nation and world.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Social Studies curriculum aspires towards the educative growth of learners as informed, concerned and participative citizens by the end of the full course of Social Studies education in our Primary Schools.</p>
<p>Lastly, in line with our school&rsquo;s vision of &lsquo;Enriched Citizen&rsquo;, we go forth committed to nurturing every pupil to realise his/her potential and to make a difference to society.</p>
