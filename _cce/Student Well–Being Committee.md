<h4><strong>Curricular Goal</strong></h4>
<p>Every Kemingnite SHINES.<br />(Safe, Happy &amp; Healthy, INdependent individuals, Emotionally and Socially adept)</p>
<p>Student Well-being focuses on developing the emotional and social aspects of the students.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</span><br />FTGP is conducted to equip students with the 5 Social-Emotional Competencies (SE Competencies). The 5 SE Competencies are, Self Awareness, Self Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Management and Responsible Decision Making. Students are engaged in class interaction activities and lessons to build relationships with their classmates and form teacher.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Bully-Free School @ Keming<br /></span>This assembly talk is held together with various classroom activities during the FTGP periods to equip students with skills to build quality relations with their peers and make responsible decisions. Our bully-free programme is split into 3 areas whereby students at the different levels discuss the various sub-topics.</p>
<p>Primary 1 and Primary 2: What is Bullying? Who are those involved in a bullying situation?</p>
<p>Primary 3 and Primary 4: Role of a bystander and how they can help.</p>
<p>Primary 5 and Primary 6: Conflict Management</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Mental Wellness @ Keming<br /></span>There will be two mental wellness talks conducted for the students in Term 2 and Term 4, a few weeks prior to their examinations to equip students with skills and strategies to cope and manage with the examination stress.</p>
<h4><strong>Other Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Education and Career Guidance (ECG)<br /></span>ECG is about empowering students in their aspirations. ECG lessons are infused into the FTGP lessons to create awareness of the various jobs that our Kemingnites can aim towards in the future.</p>
<p>There is an ECG portal (https://ecareers.sg/G_Login_SG/ecareersLogin.asp) where students can explore the various options on their own. Students become confident of their abilities and interests, able to articulate their career aspirations and the corresponding education path to achieve their dreams and aspirations. This will help them in their career development.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Sexuality Education<br /></span>Sexuality Education aims to help our young understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy relationships with the opposite sex and to teach them how to make responsible choices.</p>
<p>At Primary 5 and 6, there will be a total of 4 hours spent each year on sexuality education to educate students on three big ideas &ndash; Change, Relationship and Safety. These are covered under four main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health and Behaviour, and, Societal Influences. Sexuality education revolves around the child and has a strong emphasis on love, respect and responsibility.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Managing Change and Transition Workshop for Primary 6<br /></span>The programme aims to equip graduating students with knowledge and skills to cope with transition to secondary school and demands associated with the transition.</p>
<h4><strong>Discipline</strong></h4>
<p>In Keming Primary, values-based discipline approach is used to help our students understand the rationale behind our school rules. The students are constantly reminded that the school wants them to live the R3ICH values, build better relationships with their fellow school mates and also to look after their own well-being. That is why the school rules are there as a guideline to help them be on the right track.</p>
<p>In Keming Primary , if one has erred, we would bring them through a self-managing process by getting them to do a self-reflection and see how they could better their way of doing things.</p>
<p>If it involves more than one party, we would get them to go through a restorative practice session where both parties are encouraged to talk about the problems and how they could come together to solve the issues. This process of getting them to work with others is a good way to help the students understand that it is important to see from people&rsquo;s point of view when it comes to ironing out of issues. Besides using the restorative practice approach, we also want to help the students to go through the responsible thinking process where we get them to weigh their options before coming to a decision.</p>
