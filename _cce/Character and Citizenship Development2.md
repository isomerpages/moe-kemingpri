<p>In Keming Primary, we believe in nurturing the whole child by guiding
and helping the students to develop their moral, aesthetic, physical, intellectual,
emotional and social (MAPIES) domains to the full so that they would become
good and useful citizens. The school adopted the work of Thomas Lickona
and Matthew Davidson (A Good and Smart School), to provide the direction
for Character and Citizenship Development (CCD). Through our CCD curriculum,
the school hopes to develop our students into someone who would “Do the
Right Thing” (Moral Character) and “Give of Their Best” (Performance Character).
As a result, the students would become persons of character who would be
good and useful citizens and this is aligned with the school’s Vision -&nbsp;<em>Enlightened Students, Enriched Citizens</em>.
The school also adopted the R<sup>3</sup>ICH values (Respect, Responsibility,
Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony) as the school values and they
provide the internal compass for everyone to work and interact with one
another.</p>
<p>The CCD department also collaborates with the other departments in the
school to ensure a whole-school approach to the Character Development so
that students are provided a holistic experience in their Character Development.
While the CCD department focus on developing the moral, emotional and social
aspects, the academic departments, PE and aesthetics departments plan and
implement programmes to develop the intellectual, aesthetic and physical
domains of the students.</p>
<p><strong><em>“My Reflection Journal”</em></strong>&nbsp;is one key feature
in all of the school programmes in our focus in developing students holistically
through the building of their moral and performance character. This is
carried out with the use of the reflection journal for all Primary 3 to
Primary 6 students.</p>
<p>With the reflection journal covering the MAPIES domains of a child’s holistic
development, students are taught how to set goals for themselves across
a number of contexts, such as targets for achieving academic excellence
and setting achievable standards in both exercising habits and eating healthily.
Students are required to self-assess and review on their targets and standards
regularly with their teachers. Different subject teachers will also guide
students in reflecting about their learning after they have participated
in activities or school events.</p>
<p>The school uses the reflection journal to validate students’ learning
of the values and track their progress in the development of their moral
and performance character through the reflection records of their thinking,
feeling and actions during and after each activity or event. The teachers
will then acknowledge and provide valuable feedback to each child for future
improvement. With this purposeful approach, the reflection journal captures
the students’ learning in the MAPIES domains in order to provide a qualitative
form of assessment and feedback, thus providing an informative voice to
both the school and family about each student’s learning.</p>
<p>The CCD department comprises of various committees to look into the various
aspects of the Character and Citizenship Development. The committees under
the CCD department are:</p>
