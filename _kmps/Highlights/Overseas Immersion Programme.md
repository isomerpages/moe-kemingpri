<p>Our school did not organise any overseas trips this year due to COVID-19. The information below is taken from 2019.</p>
<p>Our Primary 5 students have been selected to go for Overseas Learning Journeys to be exposed to the different cultures around the world. During the immersion trip, our students are given the opportunity to build confidence and self-reliance through the planned activities. They also have to stay close-knitted as a team to do their best to interact, befriend and engage with the local children.</p>
