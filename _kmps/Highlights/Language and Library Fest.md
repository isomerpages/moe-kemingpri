<p>The theme for this year was&nbsp;<strong>'Going Local'</strong>! During the last two weeks of Term 3, students from P1 to P5 levels were engaged in various online and offline interactive activities that helped students better appreciate local literature and foster a love for the English language. Some of the in-class activities included&nbsp;<strong>Teatime with Local Authors</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Poetry Time</strong>. During recess, the students had to go to various booths parked outside the library to learn more about several of the local authors. The annual event culminated in&nbsp;<strong>Character Dress-Up</strong>&nbsp;Day on Wednesday (2 Sept) where both students and teachers had fun dressing up as their favourite local storybook characters!</p>
