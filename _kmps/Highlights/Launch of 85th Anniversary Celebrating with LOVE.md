<p>2020 is a special year for the Keming Family as Keming Primary turns 85. And on this day, 20 January 2020, we are honoured to have our SAC chairperson, Mrs Anastasia Liew, our School Alumni Association chairperson, Mr Casey Lim and our Parent Support Group Representative, Mrs Shirley Yuen, to grace this special occasion and unveil our Acts of Love Feature Wall. Our Kemingnites and staff are united as we rejoice with our special 55 Clap Keming Cheer, as the launch took place. Each Kemingnite also received a special souvenir to commemorate this joyous event.</p>
