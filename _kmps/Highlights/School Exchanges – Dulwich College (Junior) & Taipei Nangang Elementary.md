<p>Since 2017, Keming Primary School has partnered Dulwich College (Junior), Singapore on local school exchange. We have received favourable feedback from our students and teacher chaperones on the richness of their learning over these years.</p>
<p>This year, we also reach out to Taipei Municipal Nangang Elementary School to partner them to enrich the learning of our students. With such partnerships forged, this allows our students more exposure in international relationship building, gaining a better understanding of Southeast Asian countries and developing in them the 21st century competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities that are essential in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
