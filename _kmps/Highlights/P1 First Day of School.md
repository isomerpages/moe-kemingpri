<p>On Monday 4th January 2021, we welcomed our Primary One (P1) Kemingnites.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a parent, our Primary One students started off their first day with a handwashing routine in the canteen, something Kemingnites do daily as part of Safe Management Measures. Following that, the parents walked their children to the classrooms, wishing them a great start to their first day in Keming Primary.</p>
<p>Teachers shared routines and good recess habits just before the children got ready for recess. During recess, teacher buddies assigned to each class guided them on the purchase of food at the stalls in the canteen and guided them to the toilets. The students were given a longer recess that day to allow them ample time to familiarise themselves with the environment and interact with their schoolmates and teachers.</p>
<p>At the end of the school day, the smiles on the faces of our P1 Kemingnites showed that they had truly enjoyed themselves on their first day of school.</p>
