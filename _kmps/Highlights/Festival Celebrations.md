<p>Festivals are an expressive way to celebrate our glorious heritage, culture and traditions and strengthen our sense of community. They play an important role to connect people of different races and culture to appreciate the beauty of our own culture and cross-culture.</p>
<p>Festival celebration is an important part of MTL department&rsquo;s Cultural Learning Model where students are exposed to the different cultures and appreciate them through the experiences during the celebrations and hands-on activities. The four main festivals that we celebrate in school are Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Mid-Autumn and Deepavali.</p>
